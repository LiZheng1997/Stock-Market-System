# Stock-Market-System
This project aimed at obtaining the target stock data from websites and downloading to present in different methods. It is a task for a Java Module, so not for personal users.

The final effect is a Java GUI, and users can choose the date and the stock code to show all data they want in 
different graphs, one is a normal line chart, the other is a K-line chart which can show more data, like stock's open
price, highest price, lowest price and closed price. 

The most important feature is that I implement a dynamic viewing feature, when users move their mouse on the chart,
the aforementioned data will be shown in each data points.
